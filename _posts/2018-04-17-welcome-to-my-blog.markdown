Hello everyone! This is my first post and I want to do small intro about future content of this blog.
First of all let me introduce myself. My name is Alexander Karpov and I am software engineer and DIY
maker. Also I love open source and want to do things better. I have some ideas and opinions about 
topics above and I plan to share this.

I will try to cover the following topics:

* software engineering tips and tricks;
* useful open source software and hardware review;
* open source code walkthroughs;
* some experiments with real-world data;
* proof of concepts to solve actual problems;
* may be something else that will be interesting.

I wish you all a good day and productive work!
