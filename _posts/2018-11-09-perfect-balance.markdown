## How to find Perfect balance between quality of your code and time limits that appears in every commercial project?

How to find Perfect balance between quality of your code and time limits that appears in every 
commercial project? Yes, you can say that yon need to write perfect code out of hand. But life 
presents surprises sometimes. Sometimes very often. When company best client wants to have new 
feature in absolutely unrealistic time. You find compromise but understand that your solution is 
ugly and very bad for unit-testing. But it works and can save company reputation, your career and 
reduce risks to lose very important consumers. To be a developer for me is permanent search for 
compromises between "ideal" engineering solution from my head and real-life constraints and business 
requirements. I derived a simple rule for myself:

1. Work on selling (under the term "selling" I understand specific aspects of 
development process that has strong influence on future profit of software) code more than on quality.
2. Work on code quality as much as you can.

I do not pretend to be unique in this rule. And you can see how much non-ideal projects survive and 
beat another ones that are better from engineering point of view. Sometimes it's just power of 
marketing, but very often there are proofs that compromised solutions has more chances for win 
competitive battle.

I wrote this focused on software development in particular on coding. I have experience in build 
hardware systems from scratch and I can say that finding best compromise is a key for success on 
every stage of project life-cycle.

For me it is quite difficult to give up some solutions. I must constantly remind myself about rule 
above. I usually calm myself down that I can realize my "perfect" ideas in open-source project or in 
just for fun coding on weekend. And when I do it I can feel perfect balance.
